Contrary to my profession and academic career, I have been interested in computer and web technologies since middle school in many branches (Seo, Front-end Web Development, WordPress CMS...) I improved myself by experimenting with online training and Bootcamp processes. I have been pursuing this interest as a hobby and freelance work, and I am currently integrating it into my business life as a Front-End Developer at ID3 company. At the same time, I continue to work as a Web Manager at Bublogta Digital Content Platform, where I am the founder.",
